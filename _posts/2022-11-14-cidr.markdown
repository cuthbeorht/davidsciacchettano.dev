# What is an IP Address?

Let's start with the basics.

## IP Address Classes

- Class A
    - Public range of 10.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.0
    - Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
    - Number of Networks: 126
    - Number of hosts per network 16,777,214
- Class B
    - Public range of 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
    - Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
    - Number of Networks: 16,382
    - Number of hosts per network 65,534
- Class C
    - Public range of 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
    - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
    - Number of Networks: 2,097,150
    - Number of hosts per network 254
- Class D
    - Public range of 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
    - Number of Networks: n/a
    - Number of hosts per network multicasting
- Class E
    - Range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
    - First octet value range from 240 to 255
    - Number of Networks: N/A
    - Number of Hosts per Network: Research/Reserved/Experimental

So, what does all this mean?

For each class, there is a possible range of IP addresses that are possible based on the subnet - Don't worry, I will go into detail on what a subnet is and how it works.

Each class has a range of IPs reserved for private, internal use. Example, Class C has the public range 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0. Many home routers and bundled modem/router combo units use the IP range 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 or 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. This range is not accessible outside the router.

## Subnets

So, where do subnets come into play? Well, if you look up, each class of IPs can reserve a lot of IP addresses. And, in the past, companies were able to buy a Class A or B IP address and have all the corresponding IP addresses. To alleviate this problem, Subnets were introduced to limit the range of possible IP addresses. Here is how:

Let's say we have an IP with the following domain: `108.45.34.9/255.255.0.0`. This is how the subnet and subsequent IP range is calculated.

Convert the IP octets to binary
108 = 1101100
45 = 00101101
34 = 00100010
9 = 00001001


255 = 11111111
255 = 11111111
255 = 11111111
0 = 00000000

To calculate the range, you AND the bits

01101100   00101101	00100010	00001001
11111111  11111111	00000000	00000000

01101100 00101101 00000000 00000000

108.45.34.0 -> The `0` is the network host and is unusable.
108.45.34.255 -> The `0` is the network broadcast and is unusable.

So, the IP range is 108.45.1.1 to 108.45.255.254.

Simple, right? Now, doesn't writing `108.45.34.9/255.255.0.0` seem annoying and a waste of typing?

## CIDR To The Rescue!

CIDR was introduced to replace the class system for 2 reasons:

- Simplify writing IP ranges assigned to an entity
- Reduce the size of the IP address range an entity can reserve

Taking the previous example: `108.45.34.9/255.255.0.0` can now be written as:

`108.45.34.9/16` where the `16` means how many bits from the left are `ON` to match the subnet mask ANDing:

16 = 11111111  11111111	00000000	00000000 => From the above example

I hope that clears things up for you :)
